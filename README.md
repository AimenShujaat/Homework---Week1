The company was expected to go bankrupt but Brian stated otherwise, saying they had enough cash to bear this market collapse. 
They also suspended their affiliate program in the U.S. 
They also reduced their signup commissions to as low as US$2 as compared to US$40.

To manage such probelems in the future Coinbase intends to expand its Digital Asset Framework. They also plan to work on Risk Management as a company as well as educate their users on this aspect of Cryptospace. 
The Crypto space needs more regulations in place and Coinbase is one of the major companies in this space that works within the current rules and regulation of the Crypto Industry.

## Recommendations

One possible recommendation for Coinbase would be to collaborate with Traditional Banking Instituions. 
Usually, when people use traditional banking for depositing their money, they are not concerned about the regulatory guidelines, where are Crypto Market is still undergoing a lot of regulatory changes. 
Customers will have more faith in Crypto if the two institutions merged. It will also pave way for more people to learn about Cryptocurrencies and as the makert leader, Coinbase could use this advantage in increasing its instituional and coportate user base. 

Blockchain solutions can be applied to achieve the desired outcome. 
The decentralised nature of blockchain will help streamline all the processes and will reduce costs as well.
