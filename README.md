## Threats and Strategies

Volatility of the Crypto market is one of the major threats faced by Coinbase as it is directly affected by Crypto asset prices.

Transparency is also seen a threat in Cyrpto Space. 

In mid 2022 when Cryptocurrencies market collapsed, the CEO, Brian Armstrong did announce 18% layoffs in order to cut costs. 
The company was expected to go bankrupt but Brian stated otherwise, saying they had enough cash to bear this market collapse. 
They also suspended their affiliate program in the U.S. 
They also reduced their signup commissions to as low as US$2 as compared to US$40.

To manage such probelems in the future Coinbase intends to expand its Digital Asset Framework. They also plan to work on Risk Management as a company as well as educate their users on this aspect of Cryptospace. 
The Crypto space needs more regulations in place and Coinbase is one of the major companies in this space that works within the current rules and regulation of the Crypto Industry.

Sinc becoming public in 2021, a 513.66% increase was reported in its revenue and it's net  income saw a steep rise of 2760.77% to US$ 3.1 billion.

Although Coinbase has been the market leader in he Cryptospace with a US$ 17.63 billion market capitalisation, Binance was reported to be the 
largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume of US$ 79.88 billion in September 2022. 
As both companies deal in crypto-to-crypto exchange, they target the same markets. 

Even though Binance did not have a strong  financial backing as Coinbase did, still it has significantly grown to challenge Coinbase's top position in the market. 

Some other major competitors include 
* Kraken
* Crypto.com
* Robinhood

Coinbase still holds the position of largest Blockchain company and it has used it's first-mover-advantage in the crypto space to build a massive customer base.

## Recommendations

One possible recommendation for Coinbase would be to collaborate with Traditional Banking Instituions. 
Usually, when people use traditional banking for depositing their money, they are not concerned about the regulatory guidelines, where are Crypto Market is still undergoing a lot of regulatory changes. 
Customers will have more faith in Crypto if the two institutions merged. It will also pave way for more people to learn about Cryptocurrencies and as the makert leader, Coinbase could use this advantage in increasing its instituional and coportate user base. 

Blockchain solutions can be applied to achieve the desired outcome. 
The decentralised nature of blockchain will help streamline all the processes and will reduce costs as well.
